Limited time power ups: double damage, increased speed, and invisibilty 

Level Design: level is centered around a Castle 
  Start Sequentially 
- Courtyard entrance (meet the final boss and other bosses then they destory you initially and send to the dungeon)
- Dungeon (1st boss: Snake Executioner monster(lizard man))
- Royal entrance (2nd boss: Gargoyle)
- Library (3rd boss: Dark Mage (Design from TG Hyper Librarian yugioh card))
- Bedrooms (4th boss: Succubus monster(possibly a spider lady monster))
- Throne room (Final Boss: Dark Demon with wings with armor like Exdeath )
